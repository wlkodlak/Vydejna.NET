SHORT CONTEXTS:
* Used instead of thread ID in synchronous code, present in every log message
* For event handlers: projection name + token
* For http requests: request number (hex int)
* Other background tasks: process name + possibly some number when there are more "threads"

LOGGING LEVELS:
* FATAL - unable to start, assembly missing => bad installation
* ERROR - unexpected error
* TRANSIENT UNCORRECTED - transient error eventually unsuccessful (duplicate with just TRANSIENT)
* TRANSIENT - transient error (both eventually successful and unsuccessful)
* WARN - possible problem
	- automatically corrected error (like using default values when mandatory element is missing in non-refusable message like events)
* INFO FRAGMENT - data used to assemble one summary message for whole request
* DEBUG 1-5 - debug levels; which are actually written depends on request mode

HTTP-ONLY SUCCESS:
* URL, Postdata (optionally trimmed), Full request
* Status code, content type + response body (optionally trimmed), Full response
* Exception message, Full exception

HTTP-ONLY FAILURE:
* URL, Postdata (optionally trimmed), Full request
* Status code, content type + response body (optionally trimmed), Full response
* Exception message, Full exception

* Command type
* Command summary (needs description generator)
* Postdata (optionally trimmed) + content type
* Full response

* Corrected transient errors

COMMAND NORMAL FAILURE (validation error, domain error, warning occurred, transient error):

QUERY SUCCESS:
* Request duration
* Query summary, URL, URL + trimmed postdata, full request
* Response summary, response data (optinally trimmed), full response
* Corrected transient errors

QUERY FAILURE (bad parameters, warning occurred, transient error):
* Request duration
* Query summary, URL, URL + trimmed postdata, full request
* Response summary, response data (optinally trimmed), full response
* Error message, full exception
* Corrected transient errors, uncorrected transient errors

QUERY ERROR (unexpected exception):
* Request duration
* Query summary, URL, URL + trimmed postdata, full request
* Response summary, response data (optinally trimmed), full response
* Error message, full exception
* Corrected transient errors, uncorrected transient errors

PROJECTION REBUILD FINISHED:
* Projection name, Total events count, total duration, final token

PROJECTION INITIALIZATION:
* Projection name, rebuild mode, starting token (after possible reset)

PROJECTION FLUSH:
* Projection name, event count, flush duration, total duration (event processing + flush)

PROJECTION SUCCESS:
* Projection name
* Token, Event type + token, Event summary, event data (serialized)

PROJECTION FAILURE (due to transient error, will retry):
* Projection name
* Token, Event type + token, Event summary, event data (serialized)
* Error message, full exception
